# Indian Car Market Data Analysis ðŸš—ðŸ“Š  

## Overview  
This project explores the **Indian car market dataset** to uncover insights about pricing, mileage, engine capacity, seating capacity, service costs, and transmission types. The analysis aims to identify key trends and relationships between different factors affecting car selection.  

## Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Contains:** Car attributes such as price, mileage, engine CC, seating capacity, transmission type, and annual service cost.  

## Key Findings  
1. **Price vs. Performance:** Higher-priced cars do not show a strong correlation with mileage or engine size.  
2. **Fuel Efficiency:** Mileage is not significantly dependent on engine capacity, indicating the role of additional factors like technology.  
3. **Seating Capacity Impact:** The number of seats does not greatly affect price or mileage.  
4. **Transmission & Service Cost:** Manual and automatic cars have similar annual service costs.  
5. **Multivariate Insights:** No strong correlations exist among numerical features, implying that car selection is influenced more by qualitative factors like brand and features.  

## Visualizations  
- **Box Plot:** Transmission Type vs. Service Cost  
- **Heatmap:** Correlation Matrix of Key Attributes  

## Tools Used  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**
- **Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab** for interactive analysis
